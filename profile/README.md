# Information

Welcome to the GitHub page of Communication Theory and Application Research Laboratory (CTAR) at Bilkent University led by Prof. Tolga M. Duman.

Tolga M. Duman is a Professor of Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department at Bilkent University, in Turkey. He received the B.S. degree from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey, in 1993, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA, in 1995 and 1998, respectively, all in electrical engineering. Prior to joining Bilkent University in September 2012, he was with the School of ECEE at Arizona State University as Assistant Professor from 1998 to 2004, Associate Professor from 2004 to 2008, and Professor after 2008. His current research interests are in systems, with a particular focus on communication and signal processing, including wireless and mobile communications, coding/modulation, coding for wireless communications, and machine learning.

Dr. Duman is a Fellow of IEEE and a member of The Science Academy (in Turkey). He is a recipient of the U.S. National Science Foundation CAREER Award, IEEE Third Millennium Medal and Distinguished Teaching Award from Bilkent University. His publications include a book on MIMO Communications (by Wiley in 2007), about 100 journal papers, and close to 150 conference papers. He served as an editor for IEEE Trans. on Wireless Communications (2003-08; 2016-2019), IEEE Trans. on Communications (2007-2012), IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials (2002-07), and Elsevier’s Physical Communication Journal (2010-2016); he has served as the Coding and Information Theory Area Editor of IEEE Trans. on Communications for 2011-2019, and he was the Editor in Chief of Elsevier’s Physical Communications Journal (2016-2019). He is currently the Editor in Chief of IEEE Trans. on Communications.
